/**
 * Campus+ — Next.js proxy (formerly `middleware.ts`).
 *
 * Next 16 renamed middleware to `proxy`: the file must export `proxy`, runs on
 * the Node.js runtime, and keeping both `middleware.ts` and `proxy.ts` is a
 * build error. This file does exactly two things:
 *
 *   1. refresh the Supabase session so the auth cookie never expires mid-visit,
 *   2. send signed-out visitors to /login and signed-in visitors away from it.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* the authorization layer: every page, server action
 * and RLS policy checks permissions again (spec §106, §107). A path the matcher
 * misses is still safe — it just skips the cookie refresh or sends a guest to
 * sign-in when a public page should have been reachable.

 * account, and it changes nothing about any other route's protection. `/guide`
 * joins `/legal` and `/rules` as a public *document*: the first-visit guide is
 * static text with no query, no session data and nothing private in it, and a
 * student deciding whether to make a profile is the reader it exists for.
